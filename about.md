# About Me

Self-confession time – I am a computer scientist who loves technology, a gadget freak and a bit of a geek… and believe it or not, I am proud of all of these.

I have setup 12nines as an umbrella to release mobile software that I’m developing whilst on the tube on my way to work, on some evenings and very occasionally at the weekend.

In the course of my career I have done various roles, from developer, team leader, project manager, programme manager and the head of a technology department. As I have progressed in my career the amount of time I need to spend day to day getting my hands dirty with code has decreased. This is something that I consciously wanted to change as I enjoy programming and creating software… even if it’s just for me. When you are in a busy day job, have a family life, friends that you want to meet, hobbies that you want to participate in, time is the hardest thing to find. My inspiration for coding on the tube comes from colleagues that I work with who have similar time pressures and made a decision to work on building software on their daily commute. A real contrast to what I’d usually do… reading the Metro!

Right now I’m focusing on writing software for iOS devices, iPhones, iPod Touch and iPad.

Why Apple? I first used a Mac classic when I was in high school studying business studies and I confess that I absolutely hated it. Okay, it had a nice user interface but it was as buggy as hell and crashed all the time taking hours of work with it. I had a Amstrad PC at home and there was no interoperability with the Mac and unlike my Mac I could get access to the guts of the operating system satisfying my inner geek. All that changed when I was in the New York in 2007, the pound was strong against the dollar with nearly $2 for every £1 and I decided to buy a Mac Mini to replace the monstrosity of a PC housed in a tower sitting next to my TV as a media centre. I haven’t looked back since, the MacOS X operating system is the best out there, the hardware looks beautiful and lasts the test of time. I still have the same Mac Mini today. I bought the first ever iPod touch, I have had every single generation of iPhone and also have an iPad. I think that these devices have revolutionised the way that we use computers. I also have a MacBook and aspire to update to a MacBook Air as soon as they bring out a 15″ model.

So iOS apps for now but I do plan on developing software for other platforms as well: Android, Windows Mobile and maybe if they are still around, Blackberry.
